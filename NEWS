New in version 1.1:

* operations on two dependent random variables
* joint distribution models: normal, copulas
* joint distribution of two order statistics
* PaCal now depends on sympy

New in version 1.0:

* order statistics
* noncentral distributions: Chi^2, F, Beta and T
* optimized routines for sum, average, max, min etc. of i.i.d. random variables
* Extreme Value Distributions: Gumbel, Weibull, Frechet
* better accuracy of Beta distribution
* methods interp_error and interp_error_by_segment return estimates of
  interpolation errors
* a warning is issued when dependent RVs are used in operations
  (use params.general.warn_on_dependent = False to suppress)
* bug fixes
